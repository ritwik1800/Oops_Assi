        "# Theory Questions\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures a program using classes and objects. It emphasizes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance,\n",
        "abstraction, and polymorphism. OOP makes code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Multiple objects can be created from a single class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-  Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (short for double underscore) are special methods that begin and\n",
        "end with double underscores, like init, str, add. They allow Python objects to behave like built-in types and interact with operators and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance is an OOP feature where a child class inherits properties and behaviors from a parent class. It promotes code reuse and allows a subclass to extend or modify the\n",
        "functionalities of the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "-  Polymorphism means the ability to take many forms. It allows the same method name to have different implementations depending on the object that is calling it, enabling flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved using private variables (prefixing with __) and creating getter and setter methods. This protects the internal state of an object and restricts direct access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "-  A constructor is a special method named init that is automatically called when a new object is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class methods are methods that take cls as the first parameter and are defined using the @classmethod decorator. They can access and modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static methods do not take self or cls as parameters. They are defined using @staticmethod and behave like regular functions inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-  Python does not support traditional method overloading (same method name with different parameters). However, similar behavior can be achieved using default arguments, *args, or **kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a new implementation for a method that is already defined in the parent class. It allows customizing or extending behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is used to define getter methods that can be accessed like attributes. It allows for controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism enables functions and methods to work with objects of different classes that implement the same method name. It leads to flexibility, scalability, and extensibility in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is used to define a base class with abstract methods (declared but not implemented). You must use the abc module and @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Modularity: Code is organized into classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reusability: Inheritance promotes reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Maintainability: Code is easier to debug and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Scalability: Suitable for large projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable: Shared by all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Instance variable: Unique to each object and defined inside the init method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, gaining methods and properties from all. It can introduce complexity due to method resolution order\n",
        "(MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "- str: Returns a readable string representation for users (used in print()).\n",
        "\n",
        "- repr: Returns a developer-friendly representation, usually used for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "- super() is used to call methods from the parent class. It’s commonly used to extend the behavior of inherited methods, especially constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The del method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to release resources or perform clean-up tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod: No access to self or cls. Acts like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "- @classmethod: Receives cls and can modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism works by overriding methods in child classes. A function can call the same method on different objects, and the object decides which implementation to execute at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is when multiple methods are called in a single line, and each method returns self.\n",
        "Example:- python Copy code obj.method1().method2().method3()\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The call method allows an object to be called like a function. It enables objects to have function-like behavior. Example:-\n",
        "python Copy code class MyClass: def call(self): print(\"Called like a function\")\n",
        "\n"
